<h1>Arcade - HTML/CSS/Javascript mini-projects</h1> 

<h3>Running Duck</h3>

<p>
    First arcade game: <i>infinite runner</i>.<br>
    What happens when you're a duck trying to avoid a buoy that's floating right in your direction? You <b>jump</b>!<br>
</p>
<p>
    The game area is structured as a grid: each grid cell is a div.<br>
    While the duck will stay floating in the same point, the buoy will move one cell at a time.<br>
    You can avoid crashing into the obstacle by tapping the space bar and making the duck jump - thanks to the CSS transform property.<br>
    The progress will be easily tracked with:
    <ul>
        <li>the score: increased by ten per each obstacled that's been avoided</li> 
        <li>the level and the speed of the buoy: both increased by one each time the score will reach a value that's a multiple of 50</li>
     </ul><br>
</p>
